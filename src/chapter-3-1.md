Renewable energy has become an increasingly important part of the global energy mix, driven by concerns over climate change and the need to transition to clean energy solutions. In this chapter, we will explore the current landscape of renewable energy consumption and production, including trends in global energy consumption and production, and the role of renewable energy in meeting future energy demands.

Global Energy Consumption and Production Trends
-----------------------------------------------

Global energy consumption and production are rapidly changing, driven by a combination of economic, environmental, and policy factors. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy demand is expected to grow by 1.7% per year through 2040, with the majority of this growth coming from emerging economies such as China and India.

At the same time, renewable energy is becoming an increasingly important part of the global energy mix. In 2019, renewable energy accounted for 72% of all new power capacity additions, with solar and wind power leading the way. Renewable energy is expected to continue to grow in importance in the coming years, with the IEA projecting that renewables will account for 30% of global electricity generation by 2024.

However, fossil fuels still dominate the global energy mix, accounting for around 84% of total primary energy supply in 2018. This underscores the challenge of transitioning to a low-carbon energy system and the importance of accelerating the deployment of renewable energy technologies.

Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting Future Energy Demands
---------------------------------------------------------

Renewable energy has a critical role to play in meeting future energy demands while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. The IEA estimates that under its Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, renewable energy would provide almost three-quarters of the world's electricity by 2040.

However, to achieve this, significant investments are needed to scale up renewable energy deployment and reduce costs. This includes investments in research and development, policy and regulatory frameworks, and infrastructure.

In addition, advancements in energy storage technologies will be critical to ensuring the reliability and stability of renewable energy systems. Energy storage technologies enable excess energy generated by renewables to be stored and used when needed, helping to balance supply and demand and improve grid stability.

Conclusion
----------

Renewable energy is rapidly changing the global energy landscape, with increasing investments and deployment of renewable energy technologies. While renewable energy has the potential to play a major role in meeting future energy demands and mitigating climate change, significant investments and policy support are needed to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon energy system. By doing so, we can realize the full potential of renewable energy and contribute to a more sustainable future.
